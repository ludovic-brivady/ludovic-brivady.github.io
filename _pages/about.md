Welcome to my website! I am Ludovic, currently a research intern at EPOC laboratory, [team Methys](https://www.epoc.u-bordeaux.fr/).

I am a physicist with a strong interest in experiments and in particular in the fields of non-linear Physics, Hydrodynamics and Soft-Matter. 
I currently work on the fluvio-tidal interactions in estuaries. It is the first step for my project that is to connect physics laboratory experiments and questions in geophysics or oceanography.

Here you can find details about my (modest) research interests. For preparatory school students, I will post exercise sheets used for the oral examinations (see _Enseignement_ (FR)).
